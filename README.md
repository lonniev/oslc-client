# oslc-client
An OSLC client API Node.js module

oslc-client is a JavaScript Node.js module supporting OSLC client and server development. The client API exposes the OSLC core and domain capabilities through a simple JavaScript API on the OSLC REST services. The same API may also represent an abstract implementation of a server supporting OSLC core capabilities and domains. See oslc-server for an implementation of the OSLC REST services that delegate to this API which can then be adapted to existing data sources, services and OSLC domains.

oslc-client exploits the dynamic and asynchronous capabilities of JavaScript and Node.js to build an API that can easily adapt to any OSLC domain, extensions to domains, and/or integrations between domains.
